# The Solana Sentinel - 90-Second Demo Script

**Objective:** To clearly and concisely demonstrate the value of The Solana Sentinel to hackathon judges, highlighting the problem it solves and the technology it uses.

### Scene 1: The Problem (0-10 seconds)

**Visuals:**
-   Start with a fast-paced montage of Solana token charts on sites like DexScreener. Show some skyrocketing and some crashing violently to zero.
-   Include quick flashes of headlines about "rug pulls" or crypto scams.
-   End on a shot of a user looking stressed or confused at their screen.

**Narration:**
> (Upbeat, slightly tense music starts)
> "The Solana ecosystem moves at lightning speed. Fortunes are made, but for every hidden gem, there's a potential scam waiting to drain your wallet. How can you possibly know which is which... before it's too late?"

### Scene 2: The Solution (10-25 seconds)

**Visuals:**
-   Transition to a clean, full-screen shot of The Solana Sentinel application's landing page.
-   The logo animates in smoothly.
-   The cursor hovers over the input field, ready for action.

**Narration:**
> (Music shifts to a more confident, heroic tone)
> "Introducing The Solana Sentinel. Your AI-powered shield against risky tokens."

### Scene 3: Live Demonstration (25-60 seconds)

**Visuals:**
-   (25s) The cursor clicks on one of the example tokens, like **USDC**. The address populates the input field.
-   (30s) The "Analyze" button is clicked. The button shows a loading state.
-   (35s) The full Sentinel Report appears on screen. The animated score dial quickly climbs to a high number (e.g., 95).
-   (40s) The cursor scrolls down, highlighting key "Low Risk" metrics:
    -   "Mint Authority: Renounced" with its green checkmark.
    -   "Holder Concentration: Low".
-   (50s) The cursor then highlights the "Final Verdict" from the AI, showing the concise, positive summary.

**Narration:**
> "Let's see it in action. We'll analyze a well-known, trusted token: USDC."
> "The Sentinel instantly gets to work, fetching real-time data from the Helius API..."
> "...and running sentiment analysis on the decentralized Nosana Network."
> "And here's our report. A high Sentinel Score of 95, indicating low risk. The AI's final verdict confirms it's safe, noting the renounced authorities and healthy token distribution."

### Scene 4: The High-Risk Contrast (60-75 seconds)

**Visuals:**
-   Quickly transition back to the home screen.
-   This time, a (pre-found) high-risk token address is pasted in.
-   The "Analyze" button is clicked.
-   The report loads, but this time the score dial stops at a very low number (e.g., 15) in red.
-   The cursor highlights the "High Risk" badge and the AI's warning verdict.
-   It points to red-flag metrics like "Mint Authority: Active" and "High" holder concentration.

**Narration:**
> "But what about a potential scam? We'll analyze a risky token."
> "The Sentinel immediately flags it with a low score. The AI verdict is a clear warning: the developers still have control, and the holder concentration is dangerously high. This is a token to avoid."

### Scene 5: Conclusion & Tech Stack (75-90 seconds)

**Visuals:**
-   Show a final, polished shot of the Sentinel Report.
-   Subtly overlay the logos of the key technologies used: Next.js, Genkit, Helius, and Nosana.
-   End on the Solana Sentinel logo and a call to action.

**Narration:**
> (Music swells to a conclusive, positive finish)
> "By leveraging Google's Genkit for our core AI logic and offloading compute to the Nosana Network, The Solana Sentinel provides powerful, decentralized intelligence."
> "Don't just invest. Invest smarter. The Solana Sentinel. Your shield in the world of crypto."
